JNJ Application assignment

System specs & required packages
------

All analysis were done on MacBook Pro, OS X El Capitan, Version 10.11.4. I used conda 4.1.6 with Python 2.7.12. Following Python packages were used:

- [pandas 0.18.1](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [wget 3.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wget)

How to use
------

There are three scripts in the code folder. They are called:

- ```task_a.py```
- ```task_b.py```
- ```task_c.py```

Each script requires certain programs to be installed on the system, the details of which are in the assignment document.

The output of ```task_a.py``` is a file called ```task-a-result.csv```, as per specification.
